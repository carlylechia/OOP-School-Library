# OOP School Library

A simple program built and run using the ruby programming language which utilises the the four principles of object-oriented programming to create a simple, yet highly efficient, and interactive  user interface. This UI permits  each user to:
- add new students or teachers,
- add new books,
- and to save records of who borrowed a given book and when. 

These pieces of data are then uploaded to the database of a school library. Have fun while trying out this simple app.
